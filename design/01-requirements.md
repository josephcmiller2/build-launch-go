# Project Requirements Document

## Overview
A software platform that can automatically generate a frontend interface for CRUD operations based on a data object description. The target users would likely be developers, businesses, or organizations looking to quickly set up user interfaces without manual coding.


## MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the software platform will include the following essential features:

1. **Data Object Description Support**: The platform will accept data object descriptions provided in JSON format. These descriptions can be sourced from either on-disk files or remote endpoints via HTTP(S). The descriptions will be referenced using URIs, with file URIs based on a defined base directory (not the root directory).

2. **Master Document**: A master document will list all available data object types, each referencing its corresponding data object description URI.

3. **CRUD Operations**: The platform will support the following operations for each data object type:
   - **Create**: Allow users to input new data records.
   - **Read**: Display existing data records in a user-friendly format.
   - **Update**: Enable users to modify existing data records.
   - **Delete**: Provide functionality to remove data records.
   - **List**: Display a paginated table of objects with action buttons for Read, Update, Delete. A Create button will be included above the table.

4. **Endpoint Instructions**: The JSON document will include instructions for POST, GET, and other necessary endpoints for each operation.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform will feature an intuitive interface for developers to input and manage data object descriptions, ensuring ease of use.

6. **Automatic Form Generation**: Based on the provided JSON descriptions, the platform will automatically generate forms and interfaces for the specified operations.

7. **Responsive Design**: The generated frontend interfaces will be responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.

8. **Error Handling and Feedback**: Implement clear error messages and user feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience.


## Objectives
 - Rapid development
 - Ease of use for developers and users


## Features

1. **Data Type Support**:
   - Basic data types: Text, Multiline text, Integer, Float, Date, Boolean.
   - Additional data types: ENUM and ARRAY.

2. **User Interface Elements**:
   - **Header/Footer**: Consistent header and footer across all generated interfaces.
   - **Automatic Navigation Menus**: Generated automatically based on the JSON files, providing easy access to different sections of the application.

3. **Validation**:
   - Support for specific data types such as telephone, email, domain, etc.
   - Validation through regular expressions (regex).
   - A comprehensive list of supported named types, each mapped to an internal regex pattern.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Allow users to input new data records.
   - **Read**: Display existing data records in a user-friendly format.
   - **Update**: Enable users to modify existing data records.
   - **Delete**: Provide functionality to remove data records.
   - **List**: Display a paginated table of objects with action buttons for Read, Update, Delete. A Create button will be included above the table.

5. **Ease of Use**:
   - Intuitive interface for developers to input and manage data object descriptions.
   - Responsive design ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

6. **Error Handling and Feedback**:
   - Clear error messages and user feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience.



## Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication and Permissions**:
   - Implement user authentication to secure access to the platform.
   - Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific features or data based on user roles.

2. **Additional Integrations**:
   - **Third-Party Services**: Integration with popular third-party services such as analytics tools, payment gateways, or notification systems.
   - **API Gateways**: Enhance API capabilities with features like rate limiting, request routing, and monitoring.
   - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enable seamless user authentication across multiple applications.
   - **Webhooks**: Allow real-time communication between the platform and external systems.

3. **Enhanced Security Measures**:
   - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.
   - Add support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance user security.
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

4. **Advanced Data Handling**:
   - Support for more complex data structures beyond basic types, such as nested objects and relationships.
   - Enhanced data validation with custom rules and dynamic validation based on user input.

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times.
   - Optimize database queries and API calls for better performance.
   - Load balancing and scaling capabilities to handle increased traffic.

6. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add support for dark mode and customizable themes.
   - Implement real-time collaboration features for teams.
   - Add search and filtering capabilities within the List view.
