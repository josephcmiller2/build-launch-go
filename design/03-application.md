# Application Flow Document

## Overview

The application flow is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users interacting with the platform. It focuses on enabling users to perform CRUD operations efficiently while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly interface. It follows RESTful conventions for URL structure and includes features like confirmation dialogs and consistent navigation to enhance usability.

## User Journey

1. **Home Page**:
   - Users access the home page via `/`.
   - The page displays a list of available data object types fetched from the master JSON document.
   - Navigation is provided to manage each data object type.

2. **List View**:
   - Users navigate to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/list` to view a paginated table of records.
   - The table includes filters above it for easy data filtering.
   - Each row has **Edit** and **Delete** buttons.

3. **Edit View**:
   - Selecting **Edit** navigates to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/edit/ID` (GET request), displaying a form pre-populated with the selected record's data.
   - Users can make changes and save using the **Save/Update** button.
   - A **Delete** button is also available on this view, requiring user confirmation before proceeding.

4. **Create View**:
   - Selecting **Create/Add** navigates to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/add` (GET request), displaying a blank form.
   - Users populate the form and submit using the **Add** button.

5. **Delete Confirmation**:
   - Delete operations require user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
   - A "Cancel" button is included to allow users to return to the previous view.

## System Flow Diagram

The system flow follows a clear and logical structure:

1. **Home Page**:
   - Fetches the master JSON list.
   - Displays navigation options for each data object type.

2. **List View**:
   - Fetches paginated data for the selected data object type.
   - Displays records with filters and action buttons.

3. **Edit/Create View**:
   - Fetches specific record data (for edit) or displays a blank form (for create).
   - Validates and saves data upon form submission.

4. **Delete Operation**:
   - Confirms deletion with the user.
   - Executes the delete operation if confirmed.


## URL Structure

The URL structure is designed to be RESTful and intuitive:

- `/` - Home Page
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/list` - Paginated list view
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/edit/ID` - GET: Edit form; POST: Save/Update
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/add` - GET: Create form; POST: Submit new record
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/delete/ID` - POST: Delete confirmation and execution


## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Navigation**:
   - Consistent header and footer across all pages.
   - Automatic navigation menus generated from the JSON files.
   - Breadcrumbs to help users track their location within the application.

2. **Form Experience**:
   - Clear form labels and input validation.
   - Loading indicators during data fetching and submission.
   - Visual feedback for success and error states.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Display error messages for failed operations.
   - Provide actionable solutions for common errors (e.g., "Try again" buttons).

## Security and Performance (Future Enhancements)

1. **Security**:
   - Implement authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) for user access.
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict operations based on user roles.
   - Use HTTPS for all data transmission.

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., the master JSON list).
   - Optimize database queries and API calls to improve response times.
   - Add pagination and lazy loading to reduce initial load times.

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Add real-time updates for collaborative editing.
   - Implement search and filtering capabilities in the list view.
   - Support dark mode and customizable themes for better user experience.
