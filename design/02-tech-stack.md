# Tech Stack Document

## Overview
The backend of the platform is built using PHP, a versatile and widely-used language in web development, known for its flexibility and extensive ecosystem. PHP is chosen for its suitability in rapid development and its strong presence in the web development community.

## Programming Language
PHP: A versatile language with a strong presence in web development, suitable for rapid development.


## Frameworks & Libraries
React: A popular choice for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.


## Database
No Database Required: Since data is fetched over API calls, there's no need for a traditional database.

## Containerization & Deployment
tbd

## Documentation Tools
Swagger/OpenAPI: For documenting and testing APIs effectively.

## Development & Testing Tools
 - PHPUnit: For unit testing in PHP projects.
 - Postman: For API testing and debugging.


## Best Coding Practices

1. **Code Structure**:
   - Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
   - Use Composer for dependency management to keep the project organized and scalable.

2. **Security**:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
   - Follow the principle of least privilege when handling file permissions and user roles.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
   - Log errors and exceptions for debugging purposes using PHP's built-in logging functions or a logging library like Monolog.

4. **Code Readability**:
   - Write clean, readable, and well-structured code with consistent indentation and naming conventions.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using PHPUnit to ensure code quality and maintainability.
   - Implement integration tests to verify the interaction between different components.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Use PHPDoc comments to document classes, methods, and functions.
   - Provide clear API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI to describe endpoints, parameters, and responses.
   - At the top of each file include a documentation block that includes the file/path name.

## Future Considerations
 - Port the application to Javascript/Typescript
