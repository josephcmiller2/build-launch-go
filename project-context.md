# Project Requirements Document

## Overview
A software platform that can automatically generate a frontend interface for CRUD operations based on a data object description. The target users would likely be developers, businesses, or organizations looking to quickly set up user interfaces without manual coding.


## MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the software platform will include the following essential features:

1. **Data Object Description Support**: The platform will accept data object descriptions provided in JSON format. These descriptions can be sourced from either on-disk files or remote endpoints via HTTP(S). The descriptions will be referenced using URIs, with file URIs based on a defined base directory (not the root directory).

2. **Master Document**: A master document will list all available data object types, each referencing its corresponding data object description URI.

3. **CRUD Operations**: The platform will support the following operations for each data object type:
   - **Create**: Allow users to input new data records.
   - **Read**: Display existing data records in a user-friendly format.
   - **Update**: Enable users to modify existing data records.
   - **Delete**: Provide functionality to remove data records.
   - **List**: Display a paginated table of objects with action buttons for Read, Update, Delete. A Create button will be included above the table.

4. **Endpoint Instructions**: The JSON document will include instructions for POST, GET, and other necessary endpoints for each operation.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform will feature an intuitive interface for developers to input and manage data object descriptions, ensuring ease of use.

6. **Automatic Form Generation**: Based on the provided JSON descriptions, the platform will automatically generate forms and interfaces for the specified operations.

7. **Responsive Design**: The generated frontend interfaces will be responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.

8. **Error Handling and Feedback**: Implement clear error messages and user feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience.

# Application Flow Document

## Overview

The application flow is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users interacting with the platform. It focuses on enabling users to perform CRUD operations efficiently while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly interface. It follows RESTful conventions for URL structure and includes features like confirmation dialogs and consistent navigation to enhance usability.

## User Journey

1. **Home Page**:
   - Users access the home page via `/`.
   - The page displays a list of available data object types fetched from the master JSON document.
   - Navigation is provided to manage each data object type.

2. **List View**:
   - Users navigate to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/list` to view a paginated table of records.
   - The table includes filters above it for easy data filtering.
   - Each row has **Edit** and **Delete** buttons.

3. **Edit View**:
   - Selecting **Edit** navigates to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/edit/ID` (GET request), displaying a form pre-populated with the selected record's data.
   - Users can make changes and save using the **Save/Update** button.
   - A **Delete** button is also available on this view, requiring user confirmation before proceeding.

4. **Create View**:
   - Selecting **Create/Add** navigates to `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/add` (GET request), displaying a blank form.
   - Users populate the form and submit using the **Add** button.

5. **Delete Confirmation**:
   - Delete operations require user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
   - A "Cancel" button is included to allow users to return to the previous view.

## System Flow Diagram

The system flow follows a clear and logical structure:

1. **Home Page**:
   - Fetches the master JSON list.
   - Displays navigation options for each data object type.

2. **List View**:
   - Fetches paginated data for the selected data object type.
   - Displays records with filters and action buttons.

3. **Edit/Create View**:
   - Fetches specific record data (for edit) or displays a blank form (for create).
   - Validates and saves data upon form submission.

4. **Delete Operation**:
   - Confirms deletion with the user.
   - Executes the delete operation if confirmed.


## URL Structure

The URL structure is designed to be RESTful and intuitive:

- `/` - Home Page
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/list` - Paginated list view
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/edit/ID` - GET: Edit form; POST: Save/Update
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/add` - GET: Create form; POST: Submit new record
- `/admin/DATA_OBJECT_TYPE_SLUG/delete/ID` - POST: Delete confirmation and execution
