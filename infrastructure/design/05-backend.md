# Backend Structure Document: Infrastructure Backend

## Overview
This document outlines the backend architecture of the Infrastructure Backend, detailing the core components, API routes, database schema, and overall module structure.

## Architecture Overview
- **Persistence Layer:**
  - Utilizes SQLAlchemy for ORM with PostgreSQL as the database.

## API Routes (Proposed)
*(Note: API routes are planned for future expansion to allow external management and monitoring.)*


## Module & Folder Structure
- **src/**
  - **main.py:** Application entry point.
  - **config.py:** Global configuration settings.
  - **database/**
    - **db.py:** Database connection and session management.
  - **utils/**
    - **logger.py:** Logging configuration and helper functions.

## Error Handling & Logging
- **Logging:**
  - Configured in `utils/logger.py` with support for both file and syslog outputs.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Centralized error management across modules.
  - API endpoints (when implemented) will return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

## Future Enhancements
- **Security:** Implementation of authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
- **Scalability:** Integration with distributed task queues (e.g., Celery) and container orchestration.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring tools for performance and system health.
- **Extended API Endpoints:** Additional endpoints for managing data ingestion, processing metrics, and system configurations.
